Hello! I'm Jonathan, but you can call me by simply John, or Walker. I'm a 16-year-old patioated with coding!

I'm a British-Portuguese Python, JavaScript, HTML and C++ Developer. I also make Discord Bots for fun, normally using JavaScript, which I found out more easier to use for this kind of coding.
Anyways, I'm currently working on some bots for discord, as well as on a Personal Portfolio that I might launch in the next months.

I'm pationated with travelling, coding, Maths, Physics and Science in general. I think that Science is a way to united the world and to bring knowledge to everyone, and that's why I love it so much. I love its mission of bringing the truth to people.

C++ is really hard, to be honest :|...I'm looking to improve my C++ Developer skills. I admit, it is really hard to learn.
